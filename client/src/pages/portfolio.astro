      > during my studies at CodeClan, Edinburgh. This is a synthesiser
      and sequencer web app which uses the React framework, coupled with
      the Tone.js library and Express/MongoDB backend. Given our 1 week
      deadline and being brand new to React, I think we did pretty well
      with this. It even supports MIDI!`,

This is a browser game adaption of the popular family card game Dobble (Spot It! in the US). The player must match the symbols on both cards as quickly as possible before the time expires. It was built in a week during my studies at CodeClan, using a combination of Vue.js, Express and MongoDB.`,

It is a simple CRUD app (Create, Read, Update, Delete) that models a interactive database for a car dealership.
